# risk-engine-x

**risk-engine-x** is a real-time risk control engine based on Java, designed to provide efficient and scalable risk management solutions.  
This project integrates years of experience in credit risk and crypto exchange risk control, combining on-chain data analysis, real-time monitoring, smart alerting, and quantitative trading support. It's suitable for anti-fraud, credit assessment, risk decision-making, and other scenarios.

---

## 📌 Project Background

With the rise of blockchain technology and the popularization of digital assets, crypto exchanges play a critical role in the ecosystem by handling massive trading volumes.  
To effectively monitor on-chain activity, identify potential risks, and ensure transaction security, a high-performance risk engine is essential.  
This project aims to provide real-time market monitoring and risk alerts by analyzing:

- On-chain data (e.g., token distribution, active addresses, smart money profitability),
- Exchange K-line data using quantitative indicators (RSI, KDJ, MACD, BOLL, MA, EMA),
- Real-time news crawling and push notifications.

The engine is designed for future extension and iterative upgrades.

## 🧩 Modules

The project is modularized and includes the following submodules:

- `risk-engine-crawler`: Web crawler for collecting on-chain information.
- `risk-engine-components`: Middleware support module (e.g., Elasticsearch, MQ).
- `risk-control-analysis`: Analysis module responsible for data cleansing and risk analysis.
- `risk-engine-common`: Shared utilities and configuration module.
- `risk-engine-service`: Core business logic.
- `risk-engine-db`: Database access and persistence logic.
- `risk-engine-metric`: Feature service module for calculating various risk features.
- `risk-engine-rest`: RESTful API service for external access.
- `risk-engine-job`: Task scheduling service (e.g., message consumption, cron jobs).

▶️ Run the Services

The project uses GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub.
On the server, simply pull the latest image and launch the services.

🖥️ Server Deployment Script

#!/bin/bash

cd /opt/risk-engine-x

echo "Disk usage before deployment:"
df -h

echo "Stopping services..."
docker-compose down

echo "Removing old images..."
docker rmi bbxydcr22/risk-engine-x:risk-engine-admin-ui-latest || true
docker rmi bbxydcr22/risk-engine-x:risk-engine-rest-latest || true
docker rmi bbxydcr22/risk-engine-x:risk-engine-job-latest || true

echo "Pulling latest images..."
docker pull bbxydcr22/risk-engine-x:risk-engine-admin-ui-latest
docker pull bbxydcr22/risk-engine-x:risk-engine-rest-latest
docker pull bbxydcr22/risk-engine-x:risk-engine-job-latest

echo "Redeploying services..."
docker-compose up -d

echo "Disk usage after deployment:"
df -h

echo "Deployment completed!"

You can also start other modules as needed, such as risk-engine-job.
